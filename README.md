# Image Lablling

This project aims to build prototype using computer vision and Natural Language Processing. included my own reasearch, small algorithm, and there flow of execution. inlcudes a code that works as expected.
## Prototype

To see quick demo of this project run main.py using python3. than enter path of your image folder you want to rename it, for your convenience, i added one image folder.remember that is only Prototype version it can more usefull using computer vision object detection and advanced NLP task.

    python3 main.py

## Conclusion


By combining computer vision and NLP, this prototype image renamer showcases the potential of integrating multiple technologies to improve image analysis and generate more meaningful names. It serves as a foundation for further research and development, opening up possibilities for advanced applications in various domains.

It may rename incorrect but with including some additional capability we can achive good results
